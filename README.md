# PyMCIntegrate

PyMC Integrate is a Python package for performing adaptive Monte Carlo integration and uncertainty quantification. It provides several integration methods including:

- **Simple Monte Carlo Integration:** Uniform random sampling.
- **Importance Sampling:** Use a custom proposal distribution. 
- **Antithetic Variates:** Improve estimation efficiency by pairing samples. 
- **Convergence Visualization:** PLot the convergence of the integral estimate as the humber of samples increases.
